\section{Introduction}

Classification of image pixels into groups sharing some common characteristics is often the very first step of automatic image interpretation. Typically we wish to segment an image into blobs representing the individual objects it contains, so that they can be subject to measurements or any other mean of inspection.

Usually trivial for the human mind, unsupervised \textbf{Image Segmentation} is far from straightforward in general case. The available methods vary in complexity and principles, taking into account various image parameters such as color, brightness, gradient, texture or motion.

In the industrial setting it is often the case that the image content can be clearly divided into background (e.g. the surface of conveyor line or inspection station) and foreground (e.g. the objects being inspected). Such simple, binary pixel classification is called \textbf{Image Thresholding}.

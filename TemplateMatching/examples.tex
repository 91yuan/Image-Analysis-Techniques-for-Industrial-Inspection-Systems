\subsection{Positioning of Scope Primitives}

\paragraph*{}
Template matching techniques are commonly applied to position scan lines, regions of interest, prototype shapes, etc. over an appropriate element of the object being inspected. To do so, a characteristic object location of a fixed position in relation to the area being measured is selected, and the scope primitives are defined relatively to the characteristic location.

\paragraph*{}
Then, during the actual inspection, characteristic locations of the object instances are identified using template matching techniques, and the scope primitives are positioned accordingly, as demonstrated in \reffig{Reposition}.
